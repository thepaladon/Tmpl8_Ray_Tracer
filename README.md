## Overview
This is a CPU Ray Tracer written in my 1st Year of studying programming at the Breda University of Applied Sciences.

Please do not look into the code too deeply. This is my 3rd ever programming project. Half the code is bad and the other half is taken from [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend series](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Nowadays I am quite better at all aspects related to programming.

This project does create some really beautiful renders though. For this reason, I've decided to keep it in my Featured Projects.
